    <h2>Some things about me:</h2>
    <p>I grew up in San Diego but moved to Utah a few months before my 12th birthday. I loved surfing 
    <br> and visitng the beach, but the expenses of living in a palm tree paradise really get to you 
    <br> after a while.</p>

    <h3>Some things I like to do:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Play games with friends</li>
        <li>Learn German</li>
        <li>Program (my first language was C so going to something like JS is a bit of a relief)</li>
        <li>Enjoy nice green nature (probably why I don't like Utah and would rather live in Washington)</li>
